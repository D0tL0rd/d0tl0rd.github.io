Here I list all tips and tricks I learn daily, while working with
[Linux](https://kernel.org/) based systems.


## Set Hostname Permanently {#set-hostname-permanently}

```sh
hostnamectl set-hostname NEW_HOSTNAME
```


## Check Open Ports Using `nc` {#check-open-ports-using-nc}

```bash
# single port
nc -vz IP PORT
# Multiple ports
nc -vz IP PORT1 PORT2 PORT3
# Range of ports
nc -vz IP -z 1-100
```
