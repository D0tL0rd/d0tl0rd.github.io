## What's this place?

Hey fellow hacker ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my `(blog|engineering log|digital garden)`. This is a place
for me to share what I learn, and what I think. In other words, this
is where I note down and reinforce my experience of living, without
being worried about being judge or obligation to carry a title for
the sake of being a norm in the society. An opportunity to be myself
the way I like it to be.

## The Dot Lord?

So you might wonder who am I. It really doesn't matter. Consider The
Dot Lord, the inner child of a fellow hacker living in his 30s who
believes there should be a better way to live the life and appreciate
technology. A day to day so-called software developer who shares no
interest to follow the ancient ladder of success with empty fancy
titles, looking up to retire, to only then have the time and energy to
live, but to his surprise realizes, it's too late!
