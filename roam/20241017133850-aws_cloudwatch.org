Here I collect all tips, tricks and facts I learn daily while working
with [[https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/][AWS CloudWatch]].

* Biggest Cost Pool

To determine which log group is the biggest one over time create a
Graphed metric with the following query ([[https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/cloudwatch-logs-bill-increase][More Info]]):
  
#+begin_src sql
  SORT(REMOVE_EMPTY(SEARCH('{AWS/Logs,LogGroupName} MetricName="IncomingBytes"', 'Sum', 2592000)),SUM, DESC)
#+end_src
