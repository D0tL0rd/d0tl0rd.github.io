#+title: SSH with custom identity
#+hugo_section: tip

To use a custom ssh key (a different idnetity) to access a server, we
can use the following entry in ~~/.ssh/config~:

#+begin_src config
Host SomeName
  HostName myhost.com
  User myuser
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.myuser
  IdentitiesOnly yes
#+end_src

This is useful for example when you want to use a different identity
to push to [[id:d612a0ff-109d-4d86-936e-7beeacc3689e][GitHub]]. As long as you use ssh to access, you can
change ~github.com~ from the remote address to ~SomeName~ (in the code
block above) and you'r good to go.
